Escape from the Tower of Slime! Tower of Slime, the tallest tower in the world, in fact so tall that no-one ever managed to reach the top, hosts a number of traps and creatures, especially slimes, hence the name.

You control a brave little slime, who managed to detach itself from the vastness of the Hive, a gargantuan mass of goo known for chasing down anything resembling food, trampling with zero-to-none hesitation.

The little slime doesn't know when the tower ends, but it's hopeful that, maybe, some day it will be able to see what's outside the gloomy tower.

Controls Jump - SPACE Attack - SPACE (while jumping)

Tips You can hold SPACE to then release a even higher jump
